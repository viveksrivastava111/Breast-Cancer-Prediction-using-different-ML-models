# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-different-ML-models
<br>
<p> Overview </p>
This project implements multiple machine learning algorithms to predict breast cancer diagnoses based on medical diagnostic data. The project compares the performance of various models, providing insights into which algorithms are most effective for this task. The complete code is available in the model.ipynb file.
<br> <p> Features </p>
Dataset: Features medical data such as radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, and others. The target column is diagnosis (malignant or benign).
Algorithms: Includes Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, k-NN, and more.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Visualization: Graphs and tables illustrate model comparisons.
Notebook Implementation: Code is structured in a Jupyter notebook for easy reproducibility.
